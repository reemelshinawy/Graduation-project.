# GRADUATION PROJECT
Here's my graduation project, The project focused on developing a multiclass classification system for diagnosing eye diseases.
The project aims to address the need for an accurate and user-friendly system for identifying eye diseases. The objectives of the project are to create a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between a healthy eye and a diseased eye and to provide users with information about various eye-related problems and disorders through a simple and intuitive interface.
The project also seeks to develop a multi-classification deep learning model capable of detecting multiple eye diseases, rather than relying on separate models for each individual disease such as glaucoma or AMD, which is a commonly used approach.
